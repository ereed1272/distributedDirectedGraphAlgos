<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>Directed graphs are composed of a group of nodes that are connected
by directed edges. Many important computational problems need to be
solved on large-scale directed graphs. Examples include partitioning
graphs into clusters based on similar features, known as community
detection, as well as identifying failures in communication across
nodes, known as fault detection. Distributed computation is critical for
solving these large-scale computational problems on multiple machines in
an efficient manner. This package provides distributed functions in
Python for solving computational problems on large-scale directed
graphs.</p>
<h1 id="statement-of-need">Statement of need</h1>
<p><code>distributedDirectedGraphAlgos</code> is a Python package for
computing properties of directed graphs in a distributed manner. The API
for <code>distributedDirectedGraphAlgos</code> provides distributed
implementations of important operations including finding strongly
connected components and the finite diameter of directed graphs.
Strongly connected components are maximal subgraphs, where every node
has a direct path from every other node in the subgraph. The finite
diameter is the longest shortest path between any two nodes where such a
path exists. Finding strongly connected components and the finite
diameter of directed graphs have important implications in distributed
control and in machine learning. For example, strongly connected
components are important in designing controllable and observable
networks and in solving community detection problems. Similarly, the
finite diameter is important for fault detection in networks and
speeding up search algorithms. In general,
<code>distributedDirectedGraphAlgos</code> provides a foundation for
distributed computation on large-scale directed graphs.</p>
<p><code>distributedDirectedGraphAlgos</code> can be used by a large
population of users, including researchers, scientists, and developers.
The algorithms were previously developed and published in <span

nature of these algorithms enable scalability thereby making
<code>distributedDirectedGraphAlgos</code> accessible and useful for
future scientific explorations.</p>
